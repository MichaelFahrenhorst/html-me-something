                <h2>Snorkeling</h2>
                <p>Going snorkeling is a very cool under water adventure! I went while in Mexico right by the resort I was staying at. <br> For those that have never done it, a snorkel is an under water breathing aparatus. You're able to stay underwater for <br> extended amount of time and see the beautiful nature below the water. One of my favorite parts was being able to swim by <br> different types of fish below in the deep blue sea!</p>

                <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>
                <p>I would have to say out of all the neat things I did in Mexico, scuba diving was the best! I was able to sail out 8 miles off the  <br>coast of mexico and deep water dive. Being able to be down that deep with all the different assortments of fish was a great thing <br> to check off of my personal bucket list.</p>

                <h2>Laying on the Beach</h2>
                <p>All together my vacation was very enjoyable. The most relaxing thing you can do on vacation, Is lay on the beach and hang out! <br> Within the first day I had already burnt my skin to a crisp, but it was all worth it. I played sand volleyball, built sand-castles, and <br> ran through the tide from the ocean. Needless to say, I came back to St. Louis like a lobster due to the extreme burn from the sun. <br> If I could do it all over again I wouldn't change a thing.</p>
